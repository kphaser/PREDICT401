# Examples of calculations using the classical method of assigning probabilities.
# marginal, union, joint and conditional probabilities (Section 4.4 Black)

# Problem:  Each of three people are presented with 5 different soft drinks in random 
# order.  What is the probability the three people pick the same drink at random?
# Refer to Black Section 4.3.  Sampling with replacement.

number.of.possible.outcomes <- 5*5*5

number.of.outcomes.with.agreement/number.of.possible.outcomes

# Problem:  One soft drink is preferred by the manufacturer.  Three people pick 
# two soft drinks from 5 selections which include the preferred soft drink.  What
# is the probability none of the people pick the preferred soft drink at random?
# Refer to Black Section 4.3.  Sampling without replacement.

# First, calculate the number of combinations for a single person.
combn(5,2)
x <- c("a","b","c","d","e")
dim(combn(x,2))[2]
total.number.combinations <- (dim(combn(x,2))[2])^3

# Second, remove the preferred drink and calculate the number of combinations for 
# a single person.  Then raise to the third power for three people.

# The following examples use the Hospital.csv data set.

hospital <- read.csv(file.path("c:/RBlack/","Hospital.csv"),sep=",")
str(hospital)

# Black Chapter 1 Analyzing the Databases (page 15) has a hospital data dictionary.

# To generate a table with margins, it is necessary to convert the variables to factors.
# In this case, this is equivalent to generating nominal variables for table construction.
# Simultaneously the variables will be labeled for easy of interpretation.

control <- factor(hospital$Control, labels = c("G_NFed","NG_NP","Profit","F_GOV"))
region <- factor(hospital$Geog..Region, labels = c("So","NE","MW",'SW',"RM","CA","NW"))

# Add marginal totals and rename for simplicity.  Print the table.
# The table frequencies can be indexed by row and column.

mcr <- addmargins(control_region)

# Demonstration of calculations in Figure 4.7 of Business Statistics by Black.

# Marginal probability hospital is for profit?
mcr[3,8]/mcr[5,8]

# Union probability Rocky Mountain or Not Government Not for-profit?
(mcr[5,5]+mcr[2,8]-mcr[2,5])/mcr[5,8]

# Intersection probability for-profit in California?
mcr[3,6]/mcr[5,8]

# Conditional probability hospital is in Midwest if for-profit?
mcr[3,3]/mcr[3,8]

# Conditional probability hospital is government non-federal if in the South?
mcr[1,1]/mcr[5,1]

# Note that a conditional probability is a ratio of a single cell total (which is
# the intersection of two events) divided by a marginal total.  

# Extra problem:  Probability NG_NP but not Regions NE or MW?
(mcr[2,8]-mcr[2,2]-mcr[2,3])/mcr[2,8]

# Bayes' Theorem Calculation
# What is the probability a hospital is a for profit hospital if it is in MW?
# Refer to Section 4.8 for the formula used in this example.  The numerator in 
# that formula gives us the intersection probability for a MW for-profit hospital.
# The denominator sums up the intersection probabilities to provide the 
# probability of a MW hospital.

numerator <- (mcr[3,8]/mcr[5,8])*(mcr[3,3]/mcr[3,8])

marginal <- mcr[,8]/mcr[5,8]
conditional <- mcr[,3]/mcr[,8]
intersection <- marginal*conditional
numerator/sum(intersection[1:4])
# The denominator sums up all the intersection probabilities of hospitals in the
# MW to obtain the probability of a MW hospital.

# As a check calculate the conditional probability directly.
mcr[3,3]/mcr[5,3]

# Compare to the unconditional marginal probability.  There is a difference.
